            The Vikings travelled far and wide during the Viking Age (793 ADâ€“1066 AD), and had a major impact on
            cultures and languages across Europe and further afield. Their exploits were mainly written up in sagas
            (the best known is the Heimskringla, the sagas of the Viking kings, compiled by the Icelander 
            Snorri Sturluson around 1230 AD). <strong>But how well do you actually know your Vikings?</strong>
            <br>
            In this light-hearted game you will be shown a famous Viking, and your task is to match the Viking to the related
            tile on a grid. Some tiles have images, and some have other illustrations. <strong>Can you 
            prove yourself a Viking scholar?</strong>
