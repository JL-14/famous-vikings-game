                The Vikings travelled far and wide during the Viking Age (793 AD–1066 AD), and had a major impact on
                cultures and languages across Europe and further afield. Their exploits were mainly written up in sagas
                (the best known is the Heimskringla, the sagas of the Viking kings, compiled by the Icelander 
                Snorri Sturluson around 1230 AD).

                But how well do you actually know your Vikings?
            </strong></p>
            <p>
                In this light-hearted game you will be shown a famous Viking, and your task is to match the Viking to the related
                tile on a grid. Some tiles have images, and some have other illustrations. HINT: Clues to the facts
                are in the summary for each Viking!
