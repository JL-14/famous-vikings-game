                        The Vikings travelled far and wide during the Viking Age (793 AD–1066 AD). The original stories about 
                        the Vikings were written up in sagas. The best known is the Heimskringla, with sagas about the Viking 
                        kings. The Heimskringla was compiled by the Icelander Snorri Sturluson around 1230 AD).

                        In this light-hearted game you will be shown an image or question linked to the Vikings, and your task 
                        is to match the fact (or Viking) to the related tile on a grid. Some tiles have written facts, 
                        and some have illustrations.

                    Rollo was a Viking who conducted raids on the coast of France starting in the 800s. Scholars are unsure whether Rollo
                    was of Danish or Norwegian origin.

                    <br>
                    Following his early raids on France, Rollo also pillaged and led expeditions in England, Scotland, Ireland, and
                    Flanders. Rollo’s continual raids on France led Charles the Simple, king of the Franks, to give the Viking leader the
                    region of Normandy.

                    The Treaty of Saint Claire-sur-Epte made Rollo the first duke of Normandy.

                    He famously caused the collapse of London Bridge during a raid in England (hence the much-loved song 'London Bridge is falling down').

                    Olav was a Christian, and was the first king to convert Norway to Christianity from the pagan Viking faith. He is known as St. Olav,
                    the patron saint of Norway.

                    As claims to fame go, Leif Erikson's isn't half bad. Leif is generally considered to have 
                    been the first European to set foot in North America, a full 500 years before 
                    Christopher Columbus.

                    The son of Erik the Red, Leif is thought to have arrived in the New World in around 1000, having ventured off course en route to Greenland. 
                    His crew set up camp in a place he dubbed “Vinland”, thought to be Newfoundland.

                    Harald Hardrada is known as 'The Last Great Viking'. Harald became known as an adventurer, 
                    mercenary, king, conqueror, administrator and hero of the Icelandic sagas.

                    At the time of his birth, Norway was part of the Danish empire of King Cnut the Great, 
                    which included England and parts of Sweden. Harald travelled and raided in Europe and 
                    the Middle East (he lived in Constantinople for a few years and was head of the Varngian Guards, the 
                    bodyguards of the Roman Emperor).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After Cnut died, he wanted to take the throne, and sailed to England to do so. There he died at the
                    battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066.

                    As the conqueror of England, Denmark, and Norway, Cnut is one
                    of the most influential Vikings in history, establishing a Norse rule in 
                    the North Sea for the first and only time in history.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the summer of 1015, Cnut's fleet set sail for England with 
                    a Danish army of perhaps 10,000 in 200 longships. Cnut ruled England for nearly two decades,
                    and a big factor in why he stayed on the throne for so long was that Vikings were no longer 
                    a threat to the population!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cnut famously once tried to order the tide back from the shore, and when the tide still came in 
                    as usual acclaimed that no earthly king could compare with God.
