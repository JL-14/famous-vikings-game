            Rollo was a Viking who conducted raids on the coast of France starting in the 800s. Scholars are unsure whether Rollo
            was of Danish or Norwegian origin.
            <br>
            Following his early raids on France, Rollo also pillaged and led expeditions in England, Scotland, Ireland, and
            Flanders. Rollo’s continual raids on France led Charles the Simple, king of the Franks, to give the Viking leader the
            region of Normandy.
            <br>
            The Treaty of Saint Claire-sur-Epte made Rollo the first duke of Normandy. His descendent William of Normandy would lead
            the famous Norman Conquest of England in 1066.
